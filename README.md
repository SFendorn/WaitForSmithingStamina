# Wait for Smithing Stamina
Convenience mod to wait for full smithing stamina regeneration for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord

## Content
This mod adds the option `Wait to regain smithing stamina.` to towns if at least one party member has not 100% smithing stamina. After the stamina of all party  members is full, the smithy is entered automatically. This should reduce the hassle when doing extensive smithing sessions.

## Compatibility
Can be added mid game. Can be removed mid game while not waiting.
